## Generative AI Definition
Generative AIs are a type of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning techniques to create new content or predictions, such as text, images, audio, or video based on patterns they learn from input data.

## Generative AI Ethics
There are ethical concerns when using generative AI, such as creating misleading content to spread misinformation, issues with copyright and originality, and issues related to the use of biased and private training data.

## Generative Text AIs
Generative text AIs can be used to:

- Write and critique content, such as articles and blog posts
- Automate interactions, such as emails, texts, and chatbots
- Personalize tutoring by answering specific questions on content
- Translate text from other language
- Organize and assist in routine tasks as a virtual assitant
- Analyze and report on inputted data
- Write and edit program code

### Generative Text AI Limitations
Generative text AIs have limitations, such as generating incorrect or nonsensical responses, not understanding context, and not having access to real-time or very recent data. They may also generate offensive or biased content.

## Generative Image AIs
Generative image AIs can be used to:

- Create images both new and based on inputted templates
- Customize designs, such as clothing or housing proportions and colors before manufacturing and purchase
- Procedurally generate textures, terrain, and characters for videogames
- Augment training by creating examples images of certain scenarios or diagnoses
- Clone human faces and apply them to other images Generative image AIs have risks and limitations, such as being used to mislead others, unconsensual use of other people’s likeness, and generating biased or offensive content.

## Generative Video AIs
Generative videos AIs can be used to:

- Very accurately replace the appearance of one person with the likeness of others
- Automate labor-intensive video editing and special effects tasks
- Synthesize training data for applications such as autonomous vehicles, security, and medical training
- Generate analytic overlays for sporting events
- Enhance low quality or damaged videos
- Dynamically generate content specific to the user

### Generative Video AI Limitations
Generative video AIs have risks and limitations, as being used to mislead others, unconsensual use of other people’s likeness, and generating biased or offensive content.

## Generative Audio AIs
Generative audio AIs can be used to:

- Create music in a variety of styles
- Convert inputted text to speech
- Clone voices for use in dubbing film or voiceovers
- Restore and enhance noisy or old recordings
- Enhance customer support by providing more interactive audio support

### Generative Audio AI Limitations
Generative audio AIs have risks and limitations, such as creating content without proper licensing permissions, being used to impersonate and mislead others, and feeling impersonal when used for tasks such as customer support.

## How Generative AIs are Trained

Generative AIs are trained by feeding them massive amounts of data, such as text, images, or sound. These inputs are then studied to recognize patterns and rules, which are used to create new, original content in a similar style or format.

## Review
In this lesson, we have covered many use cases for generative AI. It is an exciting technology with an endless amount of uses that will likely transform how people work in the future, regardless of their industry.

Text-based generative AI, like ChatGPT, can offer versatile applications across various fields by creating human-like written content, such as automating interactions, personalizing tutoring, and even generating or editing code.

Image-based generative AI, like Dall-E, may revolutionize various fields by creating or modifying images from text descriptions, facilitating graphic design, customizing existing designs, and aiding in professional training.

There are many uses for audio-based generative AI. From creating new music compositions, to converting text-to-speech with natural inflection, to cloning specific voices.

Video-based generative AI is another area of innovation. It can replace faces, automate special effects, and improve the viewing experience through real-time edits and enhancements.

Despite its potential, generative AI can have drawbacks, like inaccurate responses, copyright issues, misuse, and privacy concerns. It also raises ethical questions about job losses due to automation, who owns the AI-generated content, and the responsibilities of those who create AIs, stressing the need for responsible use and ongoing research.

Understanding these technologies and their implications is key as we continue to integrate AI into various parts of our society. Only by learning more about them can we hope to best utilize generative AI in the future.
